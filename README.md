# Apache tools

In this project there will be several tools that I use for contributing for 
Apache projects.

## Tools

# Maven Authorship Plug-in

Used to verify the authors from SCM, Java Source and POM. Useful when 
you have to remove many @author tags from Java Source, and would like 
to credit the authors somewhere else, like in POM.

## Work In Progress

# Vote analytics

This tool will crawl dev mailing lists looking for vote threads. It will 
gather reasons for -1 or 0 votes, as well as CANCEL announcements. Then 
we will combine Julia for simple statistics over the data collected, and 
Twitter Bootstrap + Backbone.js for nicely displaying the results.

# Pending issues

A tool to display pending issues, with the option to sort by age, votes, 
comments, etc. This way one can address oldest or most voted issues in 
a project.
